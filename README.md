Creating a fractal using a regular polygon


This is my first attempt at creating a fractal, as I build up to making more complex examples in the future. I used Python, including Pygame in order to plot the points on a screen. I also included the modules math, random and os

The code creates an array containing the coordinates of the vertices of a regular polygon, then plots points at a fraction of the distance between a previously selected and new vertex. In doing this, a fractal is created. I experimented and researched to find the best way to do this, and made the code for the generation of the shape using knowledge from one of m previous projects

I also experimented by restricting the options for the new vertex, and thus was able to explore how fractals are generated, and deepen my knowledge of this process. In doing so I was able to create new fractals for the square and pentagon.

I experimented in adding colour in order to make my images more visually pleasing, and did so by varying RGB colour values depending on the coordinates of a pixel in relation to the screen.

I was able to recreate a number of well known fractals, such as the Sierpinski Triangle.
